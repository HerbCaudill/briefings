### Sánchez Reaps Gains from Anti-Trump Stance, Testing U.S. Ties

The newly sworn-in U.S. ambassador to Madrid has signaled he'll press Spain to commit to NATO's 5% GDP spending target — an amount Sánchez has resisted. Historians note the PM is drawing on long-standing Spanish resentment of U.S. support for Franco's dictatorship.
